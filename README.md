Create the repo on either service (Github/Bitbucket) with you as the owner.

Commit a ReadMe.md file on the Master branch of your repo

Create a branch off of Master named "tutorial" and commit/push the code from step-2 of the AngularJS tutorial to your branch.

Modify your "tutorial" branch code so that the 3 phones listed in your controllers.js file are more current phones like an iPhone 6 or Galaxy S5 (or make it even more interesting and list a bunch of funny, random items with name and snippet properties)

Modify your unit tests so that your tests will pass.

Submit the URL to your repo once you are done for grading.
